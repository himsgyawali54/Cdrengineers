            With the growing demand for engineers in Australia over the past few
            years, the competition for overseas engineers seeking to migrate to
            Australia is immensely increasing. There are various factors that
            can hold you back from the competition and your Professional
            Engineer Summary Statement is an important one.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary statement is an essential component of your Competency
            Demonstration Report (CDR) to present your engineering skills and
            experience to
            <a
              rel="nofollow"
              href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/"
              target="_blank"
              >Engineers Australia</a
            >
            in an effective way. A well-written CDR report, including a powerful
            Summary Statement, can immensely make a difference in the outcome of
            your visa application for a professional engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="../">CDR Engineers Australia</a> understands the importance
            of a summary statement in Engineering skills assessment and thus we
            offer summary statement writing service to professional engineers
            all around the world, including those from India, Bangladesh,
            Pakistan, Nepal and Australia itself. Our summary statement writers
            themselves are skilled Australian engineers and they have years of
            experience in writing summary statements for professional engineers.
          </p>
          <h2>What is a Summary Statement for Professional Engineers?</h2>
          <p>
            The Summary Statement is a crucial component of the CDR report for
            engineers who want to migrate to Australia. It provides a concise
            summary of your engineering competencies, skills, and knowledge as
            per the
            <b>Engineers Australia Migration Skills Assessment booklet</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engineers Australia uses the summary statement to assess whether you
            have the necessary competencies and skills to practice as a
            professional engineer in Australia. A CDR summary statement is
            important to ensure that your engineering competencies align with
            EA’s requirements.
          </p>
          <h2>How Do You Write a Summary Statement for CDR?</h2>
          <p>
            Writing a summary statement for a CDR report can be a challenging
            task, especially for engineers who are not familiar with the
            requirements of the
            <a
              href="../blogs/engineers-australia-migration-skills-assessment.html"
              >Engineers Australia Migration Skills Assessment</a
            >. The Summary Statement must align with the Engineers Australia
            competencies and demonstrate your engineering competencies, skills,
            and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            To write an effective Summary Statement, you must understand
            Engineers Australia’s requirements and apply your engineering
            experience and competencies accordingly. You need to identify the
            specific paragraphs in your Three
            <a href="./career-episodes-engineers-australia.html"
              >Career Episodes</a
            >
            that demonstrate your engineering skills and competencies and
            reference them in your Summary Statement. Moreover, It’s equally
            important to follow the correct format to ensure that your
            competencies are adequately demonstrated.
          </p>
          <h2>Format of CDR Summary Statement</h2>
          <p>
            The CDR Summary Statement is organized into three sections, each
            corresponding to the three competencies that Engineers Australia
            uses to assess one’s engineering skills and knowledge. These
            competencies are:
          </p>
          <h3>1. Knowledge and Skill Base</h3>
          <p>
            The Knowledge and Skill Base section of the CDR summary statement
            should provide a summary of your academic and technical knowledge as
            an engineer, including your engineering principles and your
            mathematical and scientific understanding. It also includes a
            description of how you apply them in your engineering work.

                  Writing a Summary Statement for EA requires a thorough
                  understanding of the Engineers Australia competencies and the
                  ability to effectively summarize your engineering
                  competencies, skills, and knowledge. It's essential to
                  identify the specific paragraphs in the three career episodes
