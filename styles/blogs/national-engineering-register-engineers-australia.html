                Engineers Australia established the National Engineering
                Register (NER) in 2015 to recognize highly skilled, qualified,
                competent, and professional engineers. This initiative provides
                an excellent opportunity for engineers to advance their careers.
                The NER allows those in Australia’s engineering industry to
                showcase their skills and experience to potential employers too.
                This is a useful means for engineers who want to advance in
                their careers.
              </p>
              <h2 id="requirements-to-join-ner">
                Requirements to join NER Australia
              </h2>
              <p>
                There are 5 things to consider to fulfil the requirements for
                joining NER Australia. They are
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Work Experience Statement</li>
                <li>CPD</li>
                <li>Professional Referee</li>
                <li>PII</li>
                <li>Interview</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>1. Work Experience Statement</h3>
              <p>
                Your work experience statement should demonstrate your skills,
                knowledge, and capabilities to Engineers Australia. Your work
                experience statement should be well written.
                <a
                  href="../blogs/ner-work-experiences-statement-for-australia.html"
                  >Work Experience Statement</a
                >
                should show exact specifications to Engineers Australia as it
                plays an important role in assessment.
              </p>
              <h3>2. CPD</h3>
              <p>
                Candidates must provide evidence of their commitment to CPD over
                the past three years, which should total 150 hours. Maintaining
                your CPD ensures that your NER credentials remain valid.
              </p>
              <h3>3. Professional Referee</h3>
              <p>
                Engineers must select two Professional Referees who can verify
                the statements they have made in their application to NER. These
                Referees can be supervisors, mentors, senior colleagues, or
                engineering clients who have known the engineer for at least a
                year. They should have an engineering degree and a minimum of 5
                years of experience in the engineering field.
              </p>
              <h3>4. PII</h3>
              <p>
                When applying for the National Engineering Register, applicants
                must meet the requirements of the PI insurance benefit and
                provide information on PII.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Interview</h3>
              <p>
                An interview with the applicant is required as the last stage of
                NER registration. The Professional Referees are also contacted
                by phone. Engineers who are not members of Engineers Australia
                must complete an additional step before beginning the five
                phases of NER registration which can also require qualifications
                assessment. If you are unsure and need guidance, you can always
                contact <a href="../">CDR Engineers Australia</a>.

                The National Engineering Register is intended to recognize
                qualified professionals who have demonstrated a high level of
                competence and significant experience in nineteen different
                areas of engineering. These include:

                  within the last 7 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engineers Australia Chartered Members are also eligible to

                  To apply for NER, non-members of Engineers Australia must pass
                  an assessment and provide CPD statements that can be verified
                  during the interview. While providing engineering services,
                  the candidate should also have and maintain PII insurance.
                  Applicants whose universities are not members of Engineers
                  Australia must submit a Competency Demonstration Report.

                Why Register on National Engineering Register (NER)?
              </h2>
              <p>
                The National Engineering Register (NER) is a valuable platform
                for Australian employers looking to hire qualified engineers,
                allowing employers to find the best-suited engineer for their
                organisation. This register also allows engineers to demonstrate
                their skills and experience to potential employers, as well as
                their credentials as trusted professionals in the engineering
                field. Engineers in Australia can gain recognition in their
                industry and make themselves more visible to employers by being
                listed on the NER. Note: Anyone can choose to de-register from
                the NER (National Engineering Register) at any time by sending a
                written notice to the Member Services Team at
                MemberServices@engineersaustralia.org.au expressing their reason
                for cancelling registration.

                Time Required for NER Processing
              </h2>
              <p>
                The application evaluation process typically takes three to four
                weeks to complete. If the reviewers need to request additional
                paperwork, the timeline may be extended. Engineers Australia has
                assembled a panel of highly qualified and experienced
                individuals who have also undergone extensive training to ensure
                they make informed and impartial decisions.

              <p>
                Engineers Australia may disclose sensitive information about you
                to a membership committee, board, or panel to evaluate
                applications and investigate complaints. This information can
                also be shared with members of judging committees. For
                migration-related matters, the information can be shared with
                the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and Australian
                Education International for migration statistical reports.
