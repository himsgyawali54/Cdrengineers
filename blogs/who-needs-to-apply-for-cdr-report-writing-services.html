                Every engineer must undergo a skill assessment before migrating
                to Australia. A competency demonstration report provides the
                information of competency that an engineer has so all applicants
                must provide it. Engineers Australia is the one who will be
                assessing your
                <a href="../services/cdr-report-writing.html">CDR Report</a> to
                see whether it meets the Australian standard or not. Your
                assessment will be based on your qualification and abilities.
              </p>
              <p>There are some features of the CDR Report. This includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Your individual effort and teamwork should be stated.</li>
                <li>
                  Problems that are handled by one should also be provided in
                  detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You should also provide the solutions or steps you take to
                  solve these issues.
                </li>
                <li>Rewards and honor are also stated here.</li>
                <li>

              <h2 id="reason-for-cdr-rejection">Reasons for CDR rejection</h2>
              <p>
                There is some reason why your competency demonstration report
                can get rejected. They are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>High plagiarism can lead to your CDR being rejected.</li>
                <li>
                  If you are unable to cover all 16 engineering competencies
                  then your CDR can get rejected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Before submitting your documents you should be aware of the
                  changes in MSA requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Long and confusing sentences can make your CDR rejected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Making your career episode too technical can also lead to
                  rejection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lack of understanding of EA standards while preparing the CDR
                </li>
                <li>
                  Copied content from the internet and grammatical errors can
                  lead to rejection
                </li>
                <li>
                  Insufficient information and missing problem statements can
                  also get your CDR rejected.
                </li>
              </ul>
