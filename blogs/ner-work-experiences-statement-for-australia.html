                National Engineer Register (NER) is a voluntary registration
                service provided by Engineers Australia in order to recognize
                professional qualifications and experience. It provides
                engineers with access to exclusive resources and recognition of
                their professional development. Through NER, engineers can also
                access professional indemnity insurance, discounts on
                career-related services, and Exclusive Services that allow them
                to demonstrate their competence to potential employers.
              </p>
              <p>
                When writing the NER statement, keep the following points in

                  List key accomplishments and roles you have played. If the
