                The Subclass 476 Visa allows you to travel to, reside in, and
                work and study in Australia for the duration of its validity.
                Once the criteria have been fulfilled, this visa also grants you
                the ability to apply for permanent residency. Additionally, you
                and your family members can enter and exit the country multiple
                times with this visa provided that all applicants meet the
                necessary requirements. If the holder of a Skilled Recognized
                Graduate visa is sponsored by a spouse or de facto partner who
                is an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident, or
                eligible New Zealand citizen, they may be eligible to apply for
                a Partner visa. The Partner visa allows the holder to live,
                work, and study in Australia on a permanent basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Skilled Recognised Graduate Visa (Subclass 476 Visa) is a
                temporary visa available to graduates of certain overseas
                universities. It allows the holders to gain professional work
                experience in Australia in their field of study for up to 18
                months. This student visa is intended to help bridge the gap
                between graduation and permanent residency as a
                <a href="../blogs/skilled-migration-to-australia-for-2023.html"
                  >Skilled Migration to Australia</a
                >. The key also provides pathways for holders to apply for
                permanent residence after completing their work experience. If
                you have a Skilled Recognised Graduate visa and you apply for
                another visa while you are in Australia, you may be eligible to
                be granted a Bridging Visa to cover the period between the
                expiration of your current visa and the decision on your new
                visa application.

              <p>
                An employer nomination can be an important factor in the process
                of applying for a Skilled Nominated (subclass 190) visa or a
                Skilled Regional (provisional) (subclass 489) visa, which are
                both permanent residence visas. To be eligible for these visas,
                the applicant must be nominated by an Australian employer or
                sponsored by a family member who is an Australian citizen,
                Australian permanent resident, or eligible New Zealand citizen.

                If you are younger than 31 and hold an educational qualification
                from a specified institution, you may be eligible to get an
                Australia 476 Visa. At the same time, you should not have
                already had a 476 Visa Australia or 485 Visa Australia before
                and all family members (if applicable) should meet the minimum
                health and character requirements. In addition, you and/or any
                family members need to take and pass an IELTS/TOEFL/PTE language
                proficiency test (unless you possess valid passports from the
                United Kingdom, the United States of America, New Zealand,
                Canada, or Ireland). Moreover, you must agree to the Australian
                Value Statement and pledge to respect their way of life and
                follow their laws and make sure any money is handled correctly.
