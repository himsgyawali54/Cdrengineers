                A visa for Australia can be applied for either inside or outside
                of the country. An offshore visa is requested from a location
                not in Australia while an onshore visa is applied for while in
                Australia.

              <p>
                The Partner Visa in Australia is an offshore visa. This visa is
                designed to allow foreign partners of Australian citizens,
                permanent residents, or eligible New Zealand citizens who are
                living overseas to come to Australia and be granted permanent
                residency. This visa allows the partner to remain in Australia
                permanently and access several benefits such as working and
                studying in Australia as well as access to Medicare, social
                security benefits, and other entitlements provided by the
                Australian government.
              </p>
              <p>
                The visa applicant must prove that they are in a committed,
                exclusive relationship with their partner who is either an
                Australian citizen, permanent resident, or eligible New Zealand
                citizen at the time of application. The visa applicant must also
                meet a range of health and character requirements to prove that
                they are suitable for Australian immigration. For your help, we
                at <a href="../">CDR Engineers Australia</a> are here to help
                advance your professional career in Australia.

              <h3>1. Partner (Provisional) visa (subclass 309)</h3>
              <p>
                This is a temporary visa granted to spouses and de facto
                partners who are outside Australia when the sponsor is an
                Australian citizen, permanent resident, or eligible New Zealand
                citizen. The applicant must have been in a committed
                relationship with their sponsor for at least 12 months prior to
                applying. Once granted, this visa allows the applicant and their
                family members to live in Australia until a decision is made on
                a permanent Partner visa application.

                who are living both inside and outside of Australia. In order to
                be eligible for this visa, the applicant must have been in a
                genuine and continuing relationship with their sponsor for at
                least 12 months prior to applying. Upon grant of this visa, the
                applicant and their family may live, work and study in Australia
                permanently.

              <p>
                An Onshore Partner Visa allows those who are married, engaged,
                or in a de facto relationship with an Australian citizen,
                permanent resident, or eligible New Zealand citizen to live and
                work in Australia. Under this visa, your partner will be able to
                sponsor you for a temporary or permanent visa. This visa allows
                you to stay in Australia until a decision is made on your
                application. You can also apply for a permanent visa if you meet
                the criteria. You can

                What Are The Types of Onshore Visas?
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Onshore Partner Visa (subclass 820/801) is a permanent
                Australian visa that allows the partner of an eligible sponsor
                who holds or is a citizen of Australia to travel to and live in
                Australia. This visa can be used by applicants outside of
                Australia or within Australia, depending on their circumstances.
                The Onshore Partner Visa consists of two stages. The first
                stage, the Temporary Partner Visa (subclass 820), lets the
                applicant live in Australia for two years. After this period has
                ended, the applicant can then apply for the Permanent Partner
                Visa (subclass 801).
              </p>
              <p>
                Both stages require the same application process, but it is
                important to note that if you are applying from outside
                Australia, you will need to provide additional documents such as
                a valid passport. The Onshore Partner Visa provides several
                benefits. These include the right to work and study in
                Australia, access to medical benefits through Medicare, and
                family reunion rights. It also provides the holder with
                eligibility for Australian citizenship after a certain period.

                Process For Offshore and Onshore Visa
              </h2>
              <p>
                The process for obtaining an onshore or offshore partner visa in
                Australia is quite complex and requires a lot of preparation.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, the intending migrant must make sure that they meet the
                eligibility criteria for the visa. This includes proving the
                existence of a genuine and ongoing relationship with their
                Australian partner, as well as meeting all of the other
                requirements such as financial status, health, and character.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the eligibility criteria are met, the intended migrant can
                then lodge a partner visa application either onshore (in
                Australia) or offshore (outside Australia).
              </p>
              <p>
                For offshore applications, the applicant must be outside of
                Australia when the application is made and will remain out of
                Australia during the entire processing period. We offer various
                <a href="../services/index.html">services</a> regarding these
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                For onshore applications, the applicant must be already in
                Australia when the application is made and remain in Australia
                throughout the processing period. The applicant will then need
                to provide supporting documents that prove their identity,
                relationship, and other criteria for the visa. This includes
                evidence such as birth certificates, marriage records, and even
                emails and pictures of the couple’s relationship. They may also
                need to provide documents such as bank statements and health
                assessments. Once the applicant has provided all of the
                necessary documentation, the Australian government will assess
                their application and make a decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                If approved, the applicant will then be granted the visa and
                allowed to enter or remain in Australia with their partner. It
                is important to note that there are several specific rules and
                regulations that must be followed during this process, including
                the requirement to apply for permanent residence within two
                years of being granted the visa.
              </p>
