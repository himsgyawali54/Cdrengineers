                A Competency Demonstration Report (CDR) is a customized written
                document that is used for assessing the competency of an
                engineer on the basis of their skill in the respective
                occupation category. It is the document that is required to get
                approval from Engineers Australia. So it is mandatory for an
                applicant to write a perfect CDR report. From providing a
                suitable introduction to having proper CPD, the points below
                describe the perfect ways of
                <a href="../services/cdr-report-writing.html"
                  >CDR Report Writing</a
                >. To avoid CDR rejection, it is better to have sound knowledge
                about the writing procedures of CDR reports so that an applicant
                qualifies on Engineers Australia Skill Assessment parameters.
              </p>
              <p>
                While writing a successful CDR for Engineers Australia, various
                approaches must be dealt with to avoid rejection. A good CDR
                Report serves as an assessment benchmark for the engineering
                degree you have earned, and the experience you have gained by
                working in the sector. It is very much necessary to follow
                Engineers Australia's (EA) guidelines while writing a CDR
                report.
              </p>
              <h2 id="writing-perfect-cdr">
                Here are some clinical ways for writing perfect CDR report
              </h2>
              <h3>1. Suitable Information</h3>
              <p>
                The introduction part with the length of approximately 100 words
                is best suited for a proper CDR. It should contain some specific
                information such as name, address and so on. The information to
                be contained in the introduction part includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Name of the organization.</li>
                <li>Chronological description</li>
                <li>Dates and duration of career episodes</li>
                <li>Title of the position occupied by you</li>
                <li>Location where the experience was gained.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This information should be provided in the CDR report in a
                summarized way to complete the introduction.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Appropriate Background</h3>
              <p>
                For the proper background, you should provide the content about
                where you have been studying or working. The background part
                with the length of 200 to 500 words is termed as the proper
                background for CDR. Some information to be included in this part
                are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Nature of the overall project</li>
                <li>Nature of your particular work area</li>
                <li>Proper organization of information in hierarchy</li>
                <li>Job description or statement of the duties</li>
                <li>Project objectives</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>3. Personal Engineering Activity</h3>
              <p>
                This part in CDR is the narrative's body and the primary
                assessable component. In this part, you must explain the
                personal engineering activity you have performed as an engineer
                in detail, which should not exceed more than a 1000 words. Your
                roles and contributions to the project should be highlighted in
                this part. Things to be mentioned in this part are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>How do you apply your skills and knowledge?</li>
                <li>Tasks presented to you and how you accomplish them.</li>
                <li>How do you work with other team members?</li>
                <li>Include creative designs</li>
                <li>How do you solve technical problems?</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>4. Include Creative Designs</h3>
              <p>
                In successful CDR assessment, design activities have a top
                priority. For a report to be assessed positively, technical
                creative designs create a high chance of approval. Explanation
                of technological experiences regarding design activities should
                be mentioned in CDR reports so that it gets assessed favorably.
                As creative design activities in engineering get high priority
                in CDR assessment, it is fruitful to provide the detailed
                information of the activities you have done in the CDR report.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Technical Difficulties should be solved</h3>
              <p>
                In your career episode, the project details your involvement
                with, as well as your contribution to the project as critical
                components. Each project generates some technical difficulties
                or problems. You must address such technical difficulties while
                writing a CDR report. At least three technical
                difficulties/problems should be included in your CDR report. In
                your career episodes, you must include the problem statement as
                well as the steps you took to solve it. Including these major
                information leads to writing a successful CDR.
              </p>
              <h3>6. Project Management Details</h3>
              <p>
                Project management is in charge of making sure that a project's
                goals, timeline, and budget are met. It is better to include
                duration, job description of the duties, and team members who
                were involved in the problem resolution in a CDR report.
                Technical details such as a schedule, assigning tasks to team
                members, and setting deadlines for each task on your report
                should also be included as project management details in a CDR
                report.
              </p>
              <h3>7. Summary</h3>
              <p>
                It is the dream of many people all over the world to work as an
                engineer in Australia and receive its citizenship there. For
                that, they need to prepare and send their CDR Report to
                Engineers Australia. However, many engineers struggle to display
                a top-notch CDR Report to Engineers Australia due to a lack of
                expertise about CDR writing prerequisites. In summary, it should
                include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Overall project view</li>
                <li>Contribution to the project</li>
                <li>How the project met the goals and requirements.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>8. Summary Statement</h3>
              <p>
                Once you begin to write the CDR Report, you must acknowledge
                that it contains three key elements: a Summary Statement, a list
                of Career Episodes, and a list of Continuous Professional
                Development (CPD). Each one plays a vital role in the CDR
                Report. Most assessors read the summary statement on the first
                page. It is the most important and difficult part of any CDR
                because you must illustrate all the competency elements for the
                shortlisted job category. You must provide cross references to
                all career episodes in the Summary Statement (SS). It
                demonstrates how well you analyze information, which also
                provides their initial impressions of you for migration skill
                assessment. For all three episodes, one summary statement is
                required.
              </p>
              <h3>9. Plagiarism should be avoided</h3>
              <p>
                There are various websites which have many samples of CDR. Do
                not copy even a single line from them. You can use the internet
                or other sources to get CDR samples, but only for reference.
                Engineers Australia is against plagiarism, and if they discover
                you copied the content in your report, you may be disqualified
                from the assessment for a whole year. Engineers Australia has
                many ways of knowing whether you made a genuine mistake or
                attempted to cheat. They use advanced, powerful tools and
                software to catch plagiarism. Editing and proofreading is an
                essential part of an approved CDR. So, have it checked by the
                professionals before submitting it. We at
                <a href="../">CDR Engineers Australia</a> evaluate the completed
                documents several times in order to make sure it is clutter and
                plagiarism free.

              <h3>10. Write a Perfect CPD</h3>
              <p>
                Engineers Australia has made Continuing Professional Development
                (CPD) Report a necessity for the Australia skilled Assessment.
                Keep in mind that an engineer is considered up to date with
                engineering developments through CPD. A perfect CPD includes the
                following information: title, date, duration, and location of
                the training. Continuing CPD activities should be designed to
                update or expand your abilities and skills, allowing you to
                maintain technical expertise, deal with changes successfully,
                and serve the community better. Participating in CPD activities
                even allows you to expand your connections.

              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>
                Writing a CDR is challenging as it can be technical. All the
                guidelines of the Engineers Australia must be followed and
                there's also added pressure as the CDR must be immaculate.
                Everything must be clear and concise so that the Assessor
                doesn't get confused. You must include all the points to prove
                your knowledge and skills. While the Assessor goes through your
                CDR report, you must emerge as a competent professional, but do
                not lie. For reference, go through the
                <a href="../cdr-samples/index.html">CDR Samples</a> that have
                already got approval before writing your own CDR. With a
                successful CDR, your destination "Australia" has never been
                closer.
